eXist task and bug report manager

This is an old eXist 1.0 application that I am porting to eXist 2.0.  The tasks are all software development items such as but reports, new features or documetation requests.

The nice thing about this application is that it can be integrated into other eXist project management systems,
requirement managment systems, use case managment systems and other eXist applications.
